# Hidden Elements Encountered 🌀✨

If you've noticed things happening "without any choice," you've stumbled upon the **Invisible Logic** of the Board. Here is the manifest of the "hidden" elements:

### 1. The Lasso-Loop (The "Non-Button" Capture)
The "Swirl & Save" button has been retired. The board now watches your hand. If you draw a path that returns to its starting point (forming a loop or "lasso"), the board interprets this as a completed thought. It snapshots the canvas and clears the sheet automatically. 
- **Trigger**: Close a loop of more than 20 points within a 30px radius of the start.

### 2. The Polyform Guardian (The Transition logo)
During the **Dream Stream**, you'll see a morphing abstract character—the "Polyform Guardian"—bump across the screen. This is not a logo, but a character generated on-the-fly to bridge the gap between scenes. It carries the energy of the previous scene into the next.

### 3. The Delightful Geometry (New!)
Frames are no longer just rectangles. Every time you add a frame, the universe rolls the dice. You might get:
- A minimalist **Circle**.
- A sharp **Random Polygon**.
- A flowing **NURBS-style Spline**.
- A classic **Rectangle**.

*Created with love for the invisible moments.*
